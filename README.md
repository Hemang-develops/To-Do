Simple To do application with React frontend and Django backend

To install the dependencies listed in a `req.txt` file, you can use the following command:

```
pip install -r req.txt
```

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where your `req.txt` file is located. You can use the `cd` command to change your current directory.

3. Activate your Python virtual environment if you're using one. This step is optional but recommended to isolate your project's dependencies.

4. Run the `pip install` command followed by the `-r` flag and the path to your `req.txt` file. For example:

```
pip install -r req.txt
```

5. Pip will read the `req.txt` file and install all the listed dependencies along with their specified versions.

After running this command, your Python environment will have all the packages listed in the `req.txt` file installed.

Make sure that you are in the correct virtual environment or Python environment before running the `pip install` command to ensure that the dependencies are installed in the desired environment.
